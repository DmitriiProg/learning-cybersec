Fact: First release of a Linux operating system was in 1991.
Random definition: 
Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
Operating System (OS) is a layer between the hardware and the applications. From the application's perspective, the OS provides an interface to access the different hardware components, such as CPU, RAM, and disk storage.
The graphical user interface, or GUI, is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs),which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard

As mentioned in TryHackMe (linux fundamentals part 1) linux is lightweight, though it is operated through command-line.

Commands:
echo - Output any text that we provide (we don't need to use quotes if we print one word (for example, echo Hello), however we need quotes if there is a space between words (for example, echo "Hello Friend!"))
whoami - Find out what user we're currently logged in as
ls - listing (we can understand what files and folders exist; ls <file_name> will list the content of the file)
cd - change directory (cd <file_name>)
cat - concatenate (seeing the contents of files); I accidentally printed cat without arguments after it, and I entered stdin/stdout regime. To escape it you need to press ctrl + d or ctrl + c, or in the case of virtual machine in browser you may need to refresh page (f5)
pwd - print working directory (finding out full Path to our Current Working Directory)

To be updated.
