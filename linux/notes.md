<p>Fact: First release of a Linux operating system was in 1991.</p>
Random definition: 
<p><b>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/)</b> is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</p>
<p><b>Operating System (OS)</b> is a layer between the hardware and the applications. From the application's perspective, the OS provides an interface to access the different hardware components, such as CPU, RAM, and disk storage</p>
<p><b>The graphical user interface, or GUI,</b> is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators such as primary notation, instead of text-based UIs, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs),which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard</p>

<p>As mentioned in TryHackMe (linux fundamentals part 1) linux is lightweight, though it is operated through command-line.</p>

<ls>Commands:
<ul><b>echo</b> - Output any text that we provide (we don't need to use quotes if we print one word (for example, echo Hello), however we need quotes if there is a space between words (for example, echo "Hello Friend!"))</ul>
<ul><b>whoami</b> - Find out what user we're currently logged in as</ul>
<ul><b>ls</b> - listing (we can understand what files and folders exist; ls file_name will list the content of the file)</ul>
<ul><b>cd</b> - change directory (cd file_name)</ul>
<ul><b>cat</b> - concatenate (seeing the contents of files); I accidentally printed cat without arguments after it, and I entered stdin/stdout regime. To escape it you need to press ctrl + d or ctrl + c, or in the case of virtual machine in browser you may need to refresh page (f5)</ul>
<ul><b>pwd</b> - print working directory (finding out full Path to our Current Working Directory)</ul></ls>

To be updated.
